### Steps

1. **Preferred:** Run the application using Docker for consistency and ease of setup:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. (Optional) Start the development server locally if Docker is not used:

3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coalworks.git
   ```

4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd coalworks
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Setup the database by running the migration scripts:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
